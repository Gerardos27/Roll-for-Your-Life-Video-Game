## Overview

Dice Battle Game is a turn-based strategy game built in Python that demonstrates the use of **classes, inheritance, and object-oriented programming**. Players take turns rolling a die, earning coins, and purchasing items from a store to **attack or heal**. The goal is to reduce your opponent’s health to zero before they do the same to you.  

The game supports a **human vs. AI** mode.
